The labs focus on device drivers topics and they resemble "howto" style documentation. Each topic has two parts:

a walk-through the topic which contains an overview, the main abstractions, simple examples and pointers to APIs
a hands-on part which contains a few exercises that should be resolved by the student; to focus on the topic at hand, the student is presented with a starting coding skeleton and with in-depth tips on how to solve the exercises.</i></p>
